# World-Cup-Wins
My project allows you to type in the country whose amount of wins you wish to see, and gives you the list of the world cup winners from most recent to oldest and the year that they won. 
My project allows for people who are particularly interested in the FIFA world cup to be able to see how many times their favorite team has won. This could be useful when betting/gambling, or if you just want to settle an argument. It also gives you the recent-old winners and dates so you can see where or if the champions have changed regions.
